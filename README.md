# Statistics

A project for the Specialized Master in HPC-AI from Mines Paris.

In this project we aim to resolve a series of statistical problems useful for Machine Learning. Notably, in the very well explained (in french and english) Jupyter Notebook, we analyse:

- Method of Moments
- Method of Maximum Likelihood
- Random variables, estimators, probability functions and probability distributions.
- Gaussian Process
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo
